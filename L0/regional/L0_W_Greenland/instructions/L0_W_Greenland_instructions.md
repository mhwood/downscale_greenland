# L0_W_Greenland

These instructions describe how to generate a regional simulation in West Greenland in the same resolution as the ECCO's Version 5 Alpha solution.

For reference, the global output for this solution can be found on the [ECCO Drive](https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/Version5/Alpha) and the MITgcm code to generate these files is located on the [ECCO Github](https://github.com/MITgcm-contrib/llc_hires/tree/master/llc_270).


## Steps
To generate the regional simulation, use the following list of instructions:
1. Obtain pertinent input files from ECCOv5
2. Generate the input binaries
3. Build the model
4. Run the model
5. Collect the model output in human-readable format
6. Plot results
