# Downscaled Ocean Models around Greenland using MITgcm

This repository was created to document tools to downscale ocean models around Greenland using the MIT General Circulation Model. 

All models here are labeled L0, L1, L2, and L3 to denote the extent to which they have been downscaled from existing models. All models derived from ECCO configurations. Global (L0) models are identical to existing ECCO solutions with slight modifications. All regional L0, L1, and L2 models are constructed on subsets of the "Lat-Lon-Cap" (LLC) grid and are forced with ECCO-derived data. The regional L3 models are built on manually-constructed grids which are separate from the LLC grid.
