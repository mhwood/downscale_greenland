# Downscaled Ocean Models around Greenland using MITgcm

This repository was created to document tools to downscale ocean models around Greenland using the MIT General Circulation Model. All models here are derived from ECCO configurations. Further, all regional L0, L1, and L2 models are constructed on subsets of the "Lat-Lon-Cap" (LLC) grid. The regional L3 models are built on manually-constructed grids which are separate from the LLC grid.
